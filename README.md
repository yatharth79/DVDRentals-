Project Brief

About the Company:
The dataset contains various aspects of a DVD rental
business, such as inventory management, customer
information, rental transactions, and more. The database
enables the company to streamline its operations, track
rentals and returns, and provide better customer service.

Problem Statement:
The manager of the DVD rental business is responsible for
understanding the business operations and making
informed decisions to improve customer satisfaction,
optimize inventory, and increase profitability. Tracking these
metrics seems overwhelming for the manager.

Action Plan:
You are hired by the company and expected to report
directly to the manager. Your task is to analyze rental
patterns, customer behaviors, inventory management, and
financial performance. This will ease the managerâ€™s
decision-making process and improve turnover.
